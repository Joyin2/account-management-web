# Logout Button Fix Report

## Issue Identified
The logout button in the navigation bar was not working properly due to missing redirect logic after successful logout.

## Root Cause Analysis
- The `logout()` function in `AuthContext.tsx` was only calling Firebase's `signOut()` and clearing the user profile
- No navigation/redirect logic was implemented after logout
- Users remained on the same page after logout, causing confusion about whether logout was successful

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated AuthContext (`src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`)
- Added `useRouter` import from `next/navigation`
- Added router instance to the AuthProvider component
- Modified the `logout()` function to include `router.push('/')` after successful logout

### 2. Added Test Component (`src/components/debug/LogoutTest.tsx`)
- Created a dedicated test component to verify logout functionality
- Includes console logging for debugging
- Provides visual feedback for logout status

### 3. Updated Test Page (`src/app/test/page.tsx`)
- Added the logout test component to the debug page
- Improved page layout and organization

## Files Changed
1. `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Added redirect logic to logout function
2. `src/components/debug/LogoutTest.tsx` - New test component
3. `src/app/test/page.tsx` - Updated to include logout test

## How to Test
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
2. Login with valid credentials
3. Click on the user menu in the navigation bar
4. Click "Logout"
5. Verify that:
   - User is redirected to the home page
   - Navigation shows "Login" and "Sign Up" buttons again
   - User menu disappears

## Alternative Test Method
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/test`
2. If logged in, click the "Test Logout" button
3. Verify redirect and state changes

## Expected Behavior After Fix
- ✅ Logout button is visible in user menu when logged in
- ✅ Clicking logout signs out the user from Firebase
- ✅ User is automatically redirected to home page
- ✅ Navigation reverts to showing Login/Signup buttons
- ✅ User menu disappears
- ✅ User state is properly cleared

## Technical Details
The fix ensures that after Firebase authentication state is cleared, the user is immediately redirected to the home page, providing clear feedback that the logout was successful and preventing any confusion about the current authentication state.
